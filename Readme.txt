Motivation
The goal with this assignment is gain experience creating some of the more complex elements of "vanilla" HTML. Yes, the final web page produced at the end of this assignment doesn't do anything and is rather contrived. That said, we are more concerned with getting our hands dirty than with function.

Description
This week you will be making a simple web page. You will submit a zip file to Canvas which contains exactly two files: content.html and style.css. Content.html will have all of the html content and will link to the style.css style-sheet.

In this web page, you should do the following:

1. Create a 6x6 table (inclusive of the header row) and fill in the table with your own contents.

The upper left cell should be empty. The others should be non-empty.
The table should have a caption detailing the contents of the table.
The table should have a header section, all the cells in this section should have bold text (this is default).
The first column of the table should have header cells that have italic text (these should not be bold).
The table should have a footer section (this row is not counted in 6 rows in the table) made up of two cells, one should be 2 columns wide, the other should be 4 columns wide.
2. Create a list (ul, ol, or dl) with at least 3 entries.

3. Create a div that is aligned to the left side of the page and takes up 3/4 of the page width, has a space of 20px between it and the previous element and has a class of 'outer-content'.

Its background should be pink (or any color that looks like pink).
Inside that div have another div called 'inner-content'.
Its background should be blue (any kind of blue works).
It should take up 3/4 of the parent divs width and should be centered.
4. Create two forms. One should submit via a post, the other via a get, they should have identical content.

They should submit to http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~zhangluy/tools/class-content/form_tests/check_request.php to better facilitate testing.
There should be 4 input types
A text input with a name attribute of 'text_input'
A number input with a name attribute of 'numerical_input'
A password input with a name attribute of 'password_input'
A set of radio inputs
They should be named 'candy'

These options should exist in this order
Snickers
Skittles
Mentos
Extra credit:

Make the non-header rows alternate colors. To accomplish this you will need to use a pseudo-class called:nth-of-type()
